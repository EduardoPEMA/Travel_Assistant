#### About this project:
Our final project was to make an app that applied something we learned 
in algorithmics class, so we decided to make a travel assistant.

It implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from one
country to another. The graph we work on is a preset one, stored in the
JSON file called database.json, so in order for our program to work properly
database and the app must be in the same directory.

This project is made with python, and the only requirements 
for running it are having python 3 and pyside2 installed. There's
also an .exe file for windows users so you can access the whole app 
with only one click, just make sure database is in the same folder.
